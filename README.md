# mysynth

> A fully web standards vanilla midi virtual analog synth app. 

## Build Setup

Place it into a webserver of some kind or static site service. 

With github using the action designed for static content works perfectly.

You can take a look at how this project is structed to see how you can also build a fully modern web app without the need for a build process. The real reason for a build process today is to compress and compact the code as much as possible, so that is still a valid concept, however to just throw up a one page app that is purely client side its possible to just throw something up qualicly without any proces behind it besides loading the files from server to client.
